JPARSEC tests.
<P>

This package implements tests for the JPARSEC library. The implementation
is not based in JUnit since in astronomy the tests should search for
astronomical phenomena instead of testing the results of the ephemerides
as double values, something that depends on different considerations
(ephemerides algorithms like JPL, Moshier, VSOP87, or ELP2000, reduction 
algorithms following IAU1980 or IAU2000 resolutions, and so on) since
ephemerides are not 'exact'.
<P>
