Reduction from stellar catalog coordinates to apparent positions, and ephemerides for double/variable stars.
<P>

Accurate ephemeris of stars are available using this package. The Bright
Star Catalogue 5th and SkyMaster 2000 are directly available, and support
for other catalogs is provided (Hipparcos, Tycho, and others). Reduction from catalog
coordinates is performed applying different models and corrections, using
the same objects as in planetary calculations. FK4/FK5/ICRF systems are
supported for input/output coordinates. <P>

Ephemerides for variable stars is also provided by means of the catalog by
J.M. Kreiner (2004), and also ephemerides for double stars using the
catalog of visual binary stars by Worley (1983) and Hartkopf (2006).
